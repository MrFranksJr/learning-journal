            Hello visitor, and welcome to my personal page!<br>
            This spot on the internet will serve not only as my personal testing-ground / portfolio, but also as my diary of my journey into coding.
    
            I'm currently following a course over at <a class="articleLink" href="https://scrimba.com" target="_blank" alt="go to scrimba.com">scrimba.com</a> and I'm intending on documenting my trip through the course quite thoroughly. Both from the perspective of my personal experience, as well as from a technical point-of-view.<br><br>Expect to read about the new things I learnt, about my struggles but also about what went easy.<br>Expect to read about the extras I implemented but also about bigger ideas that I had and inevitably had to abandon because of time-constraints ðŸ˜‚

            I also invite you to read up on <a href="/pages/mystory.html" alt="go to my story" class="articleLink">My Story</a>. You'll learn how I got where I am today and why I'm moving in the direction I am.

            There will be a <a href="/pages/mywork.html" alt="go to my portfolio" class="articleLink">portfolio</a> section too with any projects listed and linked that I have completed, as well as any assignments I might pick up for 'real' customers along the way.

            Finally, there's a <a href="/pages/contact.html" alt="go to contact me" class="articleLink">contact</a> page where you'll find the different ways to get in touch with me, as well as my GitHub (which was my previous diary spot).

            Cheers! Happy Coding!<br>
